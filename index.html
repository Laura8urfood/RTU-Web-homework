                <b>Oscar-Claude Monet</b> (November 14, 1840 – December 5, 1926) was a founder of French impressionist painting, 
                and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions 
                before nature, especially as applied to plein-air landscape painting.

        <h2 style="color:darkblue;">Biography</h2>
            
            <p style="font-size:110%;text-align:justify;">Monet was raised in Le Havre, Normandy, and became interested in the outdoors and drawing from an early age. 
                Although his mother, Louise-Justine Aubrée Monet, supported his ambitions to be a painter, his father, Claude-Adolphe, 
                disapproved and wanted him to pursue a career in business. He was very close to his mother, but she died in January 1857 
                when he was sixteen years old, and he was sent to live with his childless, widowed but wealthy aunt.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:110%">
                Another notable period of his life is Giverny, where he lived from 1883. He purchased a house and property there, 
                and began a vast landscaping project, including a water-lily pond.
            </p>

        <h2 style="color:darkblue;">Impressionism</h2>
            <p style="font-size:110%;text-align:justify;"> The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting <i>Impression, soleil levant</i>, 
                exhibited in the 1874 ("exhibition of rejects") initiated by Monet and his associates as an 
                alternative to the Salon.
                What made Monet different from the other Impressionist painters was his innovative idea 
                of creating Series paintings devoted to paintings of a single theme or subject. With the 
                repetitious study of the subject at different times of day Monet's paintings show the effects 
                of sunlight, time and weather through color and contrast.
